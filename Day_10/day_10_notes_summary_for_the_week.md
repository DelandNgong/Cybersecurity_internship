Week 2 Revision Notes: Basic Security Practices
1. Password Management & MFA
Strong Passwords: Use long, complex, and unique passwords for every account. Avoid reuse.

Password Managers: Tools like google password manager generate, store, and auto-fill passwords. They also protect against phishing by only filling on correct domains.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires ≥2 verification factors:

Something you know (password)

Something you have (phone for OTP)

Something you are (fingerprint)

Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are leaked.

2. Secure Browsing Habits
HTTPS: Always check for https:// and padlock icon before entering sensitive data.

Public Wi-Fi: Avoid transactions on public networks; use a VPN if necessary.

Downloads: Only download software/files from trusted official sources.

Email/Links: Hover over links to check URLs; don’t click suspicious attachments.

3. Network Security & Firewalls
Home Network Setup:

Modem: Brings internet inside.

Router: Manages traffic, assigns IPs, provides Wi-Fi.

Switch: Expands wired ports.

WAP: Provides wireless access.

Firewalls: Filter traffic between networks/computers.

Hardware firewall: Protects entire network (often in routers).

Software firewall: Protects individual devices (e.g., Windows Firewall).

Rules: Inbound (external to device) and Outbound (device to external).

4. Phishing & Threat Identification
Phishing: Fraudulent attempt to steal sensitive info via deceptive emails/messages.

Red Flags: Urgency, mismatched sender addresses, suspicious links/attachments, grammar errors.

Simulations: Tools like Google’s Phishing Quiz improve detection skills.

Advanced Types:

Whaling: Targets executives.

Smishing: Phishing via SMS.

5. Patch Management & Zero-Day Threats
Software Patches: Updates that fix vulnerabilities, bugs, or improve compatibility.

Why Patch?: Closes security holes, protects against exploits, maintains compliance.

Challenges: Compatibility, testing, deployment timing.

Zero-Day Threats:

Vulnerability: Unknown flaw in software.

Exploit: Method to weaponize the vulnerability.

Attack: Using the exploit to cause harm.

Defense: Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), behavioral analysis, timely patching.

6. Personal Security Audit
Have I Been Pwned: Check if your email was involved in a data breach.

Action: Change breached passwords immediately; use unique passwords everywhere.

Enable MFA on all critical accounts (email, banking, social media).

7. Core Principle: Layered Defense (Defense in Depth)
No single tool makes you secure. Combine:

Strong passwords + MFA

Firewalls (network/device)

Regular software updates

User awareness (phishing detection)

Safe browsing habits
