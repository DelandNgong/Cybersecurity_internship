1. The CIA Triad
The foundational model of cybersecurity, representing the three core goals of protecting information:

Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is not accessed by unauthorized individuals.

Example: Encryption, access controls, passwords.

Integrity: Maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of data during its entire life cycle.

Example: Hashing, digital signatures, checksums.

Availability: Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.

Example: Redundant systems, backups, DDoS protection.

2. The Threat Landscape
Common types of cyber threats that attack the CIA Triad:

Malware: Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or disable systems.

Types: Viruses, Worms, Ransomware, Spyware.

Phishing: A social engineering attack where attackers deceive victims into revealing sensitive information or installing malware through fraudulent emails, messages, or websites.

Social Engineering: Manipulating people into breaking security procedures to gain access to systems or data.

Types: Pretexting, Baiting, Quid pro quo.

3. Key Takeaway
The goal of cybersecurity is to implement layered controls (policies, technology, training) to uphold the CIA Triad and defend against a evolving threat landscape where human manipulation (social engineering) is often the primary attack vector.
