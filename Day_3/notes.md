Day 3: Cybersecurity Threats
1. The Modern Threat Landscape (2025)
The threat landscape is evolving, with attackers leveraging new technologies like AI.

AI-Powered Threats: Generative AI is used to create highly convincing phishing emails and deepfakes, making them difficult to detect. Automation allows for persistent, large-scale attacks.

Sophisticated Ransomware: Criminals now employ advanced measures to target and encrypt backups, removing the victim's ability to recover without paying.

Third-Party & Supply Chain Risks: Attacks on software suppliers to compromise their customers are becoming more common and severe due to complex digital ecosystems.

Cloud Targeting: The heavy reliance on cloud technologies has made security misconfigurations and gaps a primary target for attackers.

IoT Exploitation: The proliferation of interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates a vast attack surface, exposing large amounts of user data.

Other Prevalent Threats: Insider Threats, Zero-Day Exploits, and DDoS attacks remain significant dangers.

2. Core Threat Categories
A. Malware
Definition: Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

Common Types:

Virus: Attaches to clean files and spreads.

Worm: Replicates itself to spread to other systems.

Trojan Horse: Disguises itself as legitimate software.

Spyware: Secretly collects user information.

Keylogger: Records keystrokes to steal credentials.

Ransomware: Locks or encrypts data, demanding payment.

B. Phishing
Definition: A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.

How it works: Deceptive emails, text messages (smishing), or phone calls (vishing) that mimic legitimate sources to trick victims into revealing passwords, financial details, or installing malware.

C. Social Engineering
Definition: The psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

Why it's effective: It bypasses technical security controls by exploiting human trust, making it a leading cause of breaches. Attackers don't need to break firewalls if they can trick a person into opening the door.

3. Case Study Analysis: The 2016 Bangladesh Bank Heist
Summary: Hackers used a combination of phishing and malware to attempt to steal $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Threats & Techniques Used:

Initial Access: Achieved through a spear-phishing email to bank employees.

Malware: Used to gain persistent access, study bank procedures, and manipulate systems.

Data Manipulation (Integrity Attack): Malware altered the bank's SWIFT software and database records to hide fraudulent transactions.

CIA Triad Impact:

Integrity: The primary target. Attackers compromised the integrity of financial records to conceal the theft.

Availability: Printers were disabled to prevent transaction confirmations, disrupting operations.

Confidentiality: Attackers accessed highly confidential banking credentials.

Key Lesson: The bank's critical failure was a lack of network segmentation between its IT network and the secure SWIFT payment network. This highlights the vital importance of segmenting networks and enforcing strict privileged access management.
