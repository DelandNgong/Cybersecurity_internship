Day 5: Review & Advanced Threat Indicators
1. Phishing Email Identification (Review & Deep Dive)
Resource: Watched "How to Spot Phishing Emails" by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

Key Indicators of a Phishing Email:
Unexpected Emails: Be wary of messages from institutions you don't have a relationship with or weren't expecting.

Sense of Urgency: Phishers often create panic (e.g., "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!") to pressure you into making a mistake.

Requests for Money or Gift Cards: Legitimate companies will not ask for payments via unconventional methods like gift cards.

Unusual or Spoofed Domains: Always check the sender's email address and any linked URLs for subtle misspellings or strange domains that mimic real ones.

Spelling and Grammar Errors: Poor language can be a red flag, though some modern phishing attempts are well-written.

Suspicious Links and Attachments: Never click on links or download attachments from an unverified or suspicious source.

Takeaway: A combination of scrutiny and skepticism is the best defense against phishing attempts.

2. Introduction to Device Security
Resource: Began watching "CS50’s Introduction to Cybersecurity" lectures by David Malan.

Topics Covered:

Best Security Practices for personal devices (computers, phones).

Overview of Common Attacks that target devices, reinforcing the threat models discussed throughout the week.

Purpose: This provides a foundational bridge from understanding threats (Weeks 1) to implementing defenses (Week 2 - Basic Security Practices).

3. Weekly Summary
Today served as a capstone for Week 1, reviewing the core concepts of the CIA Triad and cyber threats through the practical lens of phishing identification and an introduction to proactive security measures.Day 5: Review & Advanced Threat Indicators
