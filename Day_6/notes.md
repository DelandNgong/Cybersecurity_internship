Day 6 
1. The Importance of Strong Passwords & MFA
Passwords are the primary gateway to our devices and systems, making them the first target for attackers. Implementing strong passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly increases the cost and effort for an attacker, often discouraging them entirely.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA enhances security by requiring two or more verification factors from these categories:

Something you know (e.g., a password or passphrase)

Something you have (e.g., your phone for a one-time password - OTP)

Something you are (e.g., your fingerprint or facial recognition)

Using a combination of these factors provides a robust layer of security beyond a password alone.

2. Password Managers: Importance and Use
A password manager is a crucial tool for modern digital security.

Key Benefits:
Generation & Storage: Generates, organizes, and stores complex, unique passwords for every site and automatically fills them in browsers.

Eliminates Poor Practices: Solves the common and dangerous habit of password reuse across multiple sites.

Phishing Protection: Provides a critical defense against phishing attacks. The password manager will not auto-fill credentials on a fake login page if the domain name does not exactly match the legitimate saved site.

Security of Password Managers:
They operate on a zero-knowledge protocol. Your master password and data are encrypted on your device before being stored on the provider's server. The company cannot access your passwords.

The master password is the only password you need to memorize. It must be exceptionally strong and secure.

3. Best Practices Summary
For Passwords:
Use long, complex passwords: Combine misspellings, upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols to resist brute-force attacks.

Use a unique password for every site.

Use a password manager to handle the complexity.

Change passwords immediately if a service you use has been breached.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) everywhere it is offered.

For Safe Online Browsing:
Keep personal information professional and limited.

Avoid visiting untrustworthy or "unsafe-looking" websites.

Be extremely cautious with downloads to avoid malware.

Be mindful of what you post online; the internet is permanent.

Use a secure network; employ a VPN, especially on public Wi-Fi.

Be cautious of online strangers; social engineering is a common attack vector.

Only shop on secure websites (look for https:// and the padlock icon).

Keep your browser and anti-virus software updated.
