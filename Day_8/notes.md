Day 8, Phishing Practice and Security Check
1. Phishing Quiz Results
Took Google’s phishing quiz and scored 100% – correctly identified all phishing and real emails.

Took Dropbox’s phishing quiz and scored 80% – got 20% wrong by mistaking some real emails for phishing (false positive).

2. Personal Email Check:
Went though my eamils to check for Pfishing emails, found a suspicious email from wordpress@ramworkstx.com offering a $500 bonus and a password setup link.

This is likely phishing: the sender address isn’t official WordPress, and the offer seems fake.

3. Have I Been Pwned Check:
Checked my email on https://haveibeenpwned.com/

My email was in a 2024 data breach from a betting site that affected 96 million users.

leaked data: emails, phone numbers, birth dates, passwords, locations, IP addresses.

I already changed my password since then, so I’m safe.

4. Other Phishing Types
Whaling: Phishing attacks targeting CEOs or high-level executives.

Smishing: Phishing done through SMS/text messages.
